# My Configuration For Sway

These are my configuration files for the sway compositor, a lightweight 
desktop environment (i.e. the GUI which allows you open applications, see a 
panel, etc.).

## Usage

If you want to use this config, just clone this repository and run `make 
install` from inside it. You can run `make uninstall` later to remove it 
again.


## TODO

- update waybar workspaces icon on signal
